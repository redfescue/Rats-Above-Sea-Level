Rats Above Sea Level is a altimeter which uses a servo-driven slider to indicate altitude. Two different versions are documented. 
          Arduino IDE version
          Arduino Cloud WiFi version
Both versions require an input of the current sea level barometric pressure. Sea level barometric pressure is entered into the Skech 
in the IDE version and it is entered into the IOT dashboard on the WiFi version. 
This altitude is displayed on a servo-driven channel slider track.

The original IDE version uses the following parts:
          Arduino Uno  
          BMP280 Pressure Sensor
          Ultrasonic sensor
          Display
          potientiometer
          Servo City HS-785HB Channel Slider Kit (discontinued)
          Breadboard 2X 400 pin
          GoBilda 3100ma-hr 6.8V batter (Servo City)



The IOT version uses
          Arduino Uno R4 WiFi - IOT Cloud 
          BMP280 Pressure Sensor
          Servo City HS-785HB Channel Slider Kit (discontinued)
          Sparkfun Arduino and Breadboard Holder
          Breadboard
          GoBilda 3100ma-hr 6.8V batter (Servo City)
          IPad

The program takes as inputs the ambient pressure as measured by the BMP280 and the sea-level barometric pressure as entered on the
IDE or the IOT Remote and calculates the altitude. 
This altitude is converted into a pulse width which is used to drive the servo motor to display the altitude in
feet (Rats Above Sea Level).
